# FastHTML

> FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's `FT` "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications. The `FastHTML` class itself inherits from `Starlette`, and adds decorator-based routing with many additions, Beforeware, automatic `FT` to HTML rendering, and much more. Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is *not* compatible with FastAPI syntax and is not targeted at creating API services. FastHTML includes support for Pico CSS and the fastlite sqlite library, although using both are optional; sqlite can be used directly or via the fastsql library, and any CSS framework can be used. FastHTML is compatible with web components and any vanilla JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte. Support for the Surreal and css-scope-inline libraries are also included, but both are optional.
